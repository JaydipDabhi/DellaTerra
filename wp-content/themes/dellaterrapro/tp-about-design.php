                     <p>Jenny and Bryant Hadden are a husband and wife duo who have invested in real estate and have been short term rental owners for over decade.</p>
                     <p>In their own home, some of their greatest joys are hosting people for dinner, and afterwards having either a summer water fight with kids and adults alike, or a fall fire pit and s’mores night! They desire to bring that feeling of peace and joy of home to their work.</p>
                     <p>What’s next? The duo dreams of and is working towards co-owning a mountain retreat center for work groups. They need various partners to do this, and plan to do other fun projects along the way! Until then, they’re stoked to continue supporting teams to live out their extraordinary mission both now and in the future through real estate and hospitality adventures!</p>

            <div class="founder-detail">
                  <picture class="right-side"><img src="<?php echo esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ); ?>/assets/images/jenny-hadden.webp" alt="jenny-hadden"  height="500" width="545"/></picture></picture>
                  <p>Jenny is known for her warm hospitality and her proven ability to drive profits.</p>
                  <p>Her mission is to serve and ignite leaders & groups like yours to discover & live the extraordinary mission they’ve always wanted to achieve! With a passion for serving and igniting leaders, she is dedicated to helping you uncover and embrace the path you’ve always dreamed of. Whether through real estate place-making or hospitality ventures, Jenny is committed to creating the perfect environment for your success and fulfillment.</p>
                  <p>Embarking on her journey as an NCAA gymnast for Stanford University, Jenny was inspired by the power of a unified team. Despite initially joining the team without a scholarship, her dedication led her to earn a full ride after her first year. Her team achieved multiple top 4 NCAA National finishes, and she earned the distinction of being a 4-time academic All American. Jenny holds BA and MA Business degrees in Communication – Media Studies from Stanford.</p>
                  <p>For 13 years, Jenny immersed herself in the startup tech scene in both New Zealand and the US. She held management roles across marketing, product development, and strategy. Throughout this period, she felt drawn towards a more impactful and adventurous lifestyle, one that allowed her more flexibility in pursuing her passions intersecting business, teams, and hospitality. Consequently, she ventured into side hustles establishing non profits, launching short term rentals, and ultimately founding her own business consulting firm, Hadden Consulting Group.</p>
                  <p>Since 2014, the firm has maintained near ~100% repeat clientele and specializes in strategy & marketing consulting.</p>
                  <p>In 2021, she followed God’s nudge further into hospitality and real estate, co-owning Evergreen Enterprises, a multi-million dollar real estate company that develops properties, owns restaurants and bars, and provides property management for its locations. Over three years, she built and contributed to its values, systems and operations for scale while directing leaders at both new and existing concepts.</p>
                  <p>In 2023, she entered into a minority partnership with her brother Mike and father Paul for Arliss Holdings, a small family private equity investment firm. For Arliss, her focus lies in seeking partners for co-investment opportunities in mixed-used commercial properties and apartment buildings in Omaha, NE. While maintaining her role as aminority partner & advisor in Evergreen and Arliss Holdings, she continues to pursue her passion for investment and entrepreneurship for the next generation.</p>
                  <p>In 2023, Jenny & her husband Bryant launched Della Terra and its real estate and hospitality portfolio & services as her primary revenue stream! They had built up cash and expertise through managing their own assets in the last decade to reach this gifted milestone.</p>
                  <p>In the same year, Jenny and her husband Bryant launched Della Terra and its real estate and hospitality portfolio and advisory services. This became their primary focus. Over the past decade, they put in labors of love to build up both cash reserves, partners and expertise through managing their own assets, culminating to this significant milestone.</p>
                  <p>In 2024, Jenny, alongside Bryant and their three young girls, moved to a Northern Arizona mountain community in pursuit of enriching outdoor experiences and hospitality opportunities. The company expanded its offerings to include advisory services for strategic partners. They also broadened its ownership portfolio to continue long-distance investments.</p>
                  <p>What’s next? Della Terra is poised to expand into adjacent real estate hospitality solutions in the coming years. Long term, the duo is working towards co-owning a mountain retreat center for groups. They eagerly seek like-minded partners for this venture and plan to do other fun projects along the way!</p>
                  <p>Della Terra is excited to continue supporting clients like you in realizing your extraordinary mission through its real estate and hospitality ventures!</p>
                  <p>Reach out at info@dellaterrapro.com, and let’s discuss how Della Terra might be able to collaborate with you!</p>
